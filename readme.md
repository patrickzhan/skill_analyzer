# Software Engineering Skills Analyzer (unfinished)

## Objective
To create a tool that collects and analyzes job posting and industry trends to identify skill required for entry-level, mid-level, and senior software engineering roles.

## Features

### Data Collection

- Scrape job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed) for software engineering positions.
- Filter by role levels (e.g., "Junior," "Mid-level," "Senior").
- Collect data points such as:
  * Required programming languages.
  * Frameworks and tools.
  * Soft skills (e.g., communication, problem-solving).
  * Years of experience.

### Data Analysis

- Categorize skills by:
  * Programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
  * Tools/technologies (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes).
  * Role levels (entry, mid, senior).
- Highlight trends (e.g., "Python is more common in entry-level roles").
- Compare demand across regions or industries.

### Visualization

- Create charts and graphs:
  * Skills demand by role level.
  * Popular programming languages or tools.
  * Trends over time.
- Option to export insights as a report.

### API/CLI Interface

- Provide an API or CLI to query insights.
- Example: "What are the top 5 skills for senior software engineers?"

### User Interaction

- Create a simple UI dashboard (or skip this if you prefer backend/API focus).

### Tech Stack
- Backend/Data Processing: Python (Flask/FastAPI, Pandas, Beautiful Soup/Scrapy).
- Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing job data.
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for graphs; Streamlit for a lightweight dashboard.
- Cloud (Optional): Deploy on AWS/GCP/Azure for data storage and processing.
- Machine Learning (Optional Advanced Feature):
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and categorize skills from job descriptions (e.g., with Spacy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers).
